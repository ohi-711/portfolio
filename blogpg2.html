                <h2 id="20190403">Music Genre Classification using Deep Learning</h2>
                <h5>Literature Review, Apr. 3, 2019</h5>
                <img src="pics/Genres.png" alt="Genres" style="width:80%">

                <p>Last term, in my Introduction to Machine Intelligence course, I completed a project involving music
                    genre
                    classification on raw audio, using a supervised (labelled) machine learning (ML) model.
                    Traditionally, music
                    genres are difficult to distinguish since genres are generally ill-defined, so it is a classic ML
                    problem.
                    When I researched for inspirations and clues on how to process the data and build the ML models, I
                    came across
                    the papers presented here. As my initial experimentations were unsuccessful, the processes described
                    in these
                    papers were essential for turning the raw audio (in mp3 format) into useful information by capturing
                    data
                    features. They also helped me develop a neural network (NN) that worked well on the processed audio
                    data,
                    which was able to achieve over 80% test accuracy. Each of these papers covered a complete ML
                    workflow from
                    pre-processing to training and results. </p>

                <p>The first paper, written by Bahuleyan [1], discussed his proposed solution of training a music genre
                    classifier. He started by using 10-second sound clips from each song used in the training data. This
                    is
                    important as audio data can become very large. Having too much data would be impractical. I took
                    this advice
                    in my project, which significantly shortened data processing time. Then, the article described
                    multiple
                    techniques of sound feature extraction. This would capture important details in the sound audio that
                    would
                    make it easier to distinguish between music genres. The article compared general techniques such as
                    dropout,
                    normalization, and time and frequency domain features. Based on the analysis here using a set of
                    defined
                    metrics, it concluded that taking the Mel-frequency cestrum coefficients (MFCC), a frequency-domain
                    feature,
                    is the most effective method. This was very helpful as I later used MFCCs in my project. The paper
                    further
                    presented different ML techniques used (both NNs and non-NN approaches), which were somewhat helpful
                    for my
                    project. However, it did not present any specific model structures he used. Overall, to me, this
                    paper offers
                    a great methodological approach in finding the best data pre-processing technique for audio. </p>

                <p>The second paper, by Nasrullah and Zhao [2], presented the use of a convolutional recurrent neural
                    network
                    (CRNN) for music artist classification. First, it discussed pre-processing techniques for audio such
                    MFCCs,
                    which validated the research from the first article about its effectiveness. Yet, more emphasis was
                    put on
                    using spectrograms, a representation of frequency content over time. However, the most important
                    takeaway from
                    this paper is that a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural
                    networks (RNN)
                    work well together to capture audio features. CNNs are good for frequency-domain features, while
                    RNNs are good
                    for any sequential data (along the time-domain). Therefore, the paper proposed the use of a CRNN to
                    capture
                    audio features from both time and frequency domains. It was even more helpful when it provided the
                    neural
                    network architecture used for this research, which gave me an idea of how to build my own NN.
                    Overall, this
                    paper validated some of the previous point made in the first paper regarding pre-processing
                    techniques and
                    provided more information on how to build the NN structure. </p>

                <p>The third and final paper here by Oramas [3] is more advanced and extensive, where it covered the
                    entire
                    process from data representation to training and results, while bringing in a lot of new ideas not
                    mentioned
                    in previous articles. In data pre-processing and representation, aside from validating the
                    techniques
                    mentioned above (audio and visual representations for time and frequency-domain), it also offered
                    text
                    representation (from song lyrics), which gave me an alternative to only collecting audio data. The
                    paper
                    further discussed feature engineering that involved mathematical reduction of existing features,
                    such as
                    factorization. In the training section, the paper showcased both single-label and multi-label music
                    genre
                    classification. This is important since most music crosses between several genres, due to the
                    ill-defined
                    nature of music genres. It offered the possibility to classify songs under multiple genres, that
                    would require
                    slightly different neural network structures. These revised NNs were also presented in this paper.
                    Finally,
                    this paper talked about methods of qualitative analysis for classification error, such as confusion
                    matrices
                    and feature heat maps. This was useful for helping me formulate my own error analysis for the
                    project.
                    Overall, due to the extensiveness of this paper, I was able to learn significantly more about how to
                    formulate
                    my own music genre classifier, and offered me alternatives if the previous methods fail. </p>

                <p>Overall, all three papers provided significant clues on how to build a working deep-learning model
                    for music
                    genre classification from raw audio. It discussed methods of data representation and pre-processing
                    techniques, most importantly the effectiveness of MFCCs. They also gave insight on constructing the
                    neural
                    network, where I learned that using a combination of CNNs and RNNs (CRNNs) appears to be the most
                    effective in
                    capturing features from both the time and frequency domains. Finally, they talked about error
                    analysis
                    techniques. All the information gathered here were essential in helping me complete a successful
                    project.</p>

                <h5>Environmental Sustainability Paper, Jan. 11, 2019</h5>
                <img src="pics/google-deepmind.jpg" alt="Google" style="width:80%">

                <p>In artificial intelligence, an important milestone is the ability for a computer program to
                    learn to play a game. Google, one of the global leaders in artificial intelligence, created the
                    program AlphaGo to play the game of Go, and more recently, developed AlphaZero to master
                    multiple board games, including Go, chess, and shogi (Japanese chess) [1]. AlphaZero is claimed
                    to be “extraordinarily” efficient and sets a benchmark for future artificial intelligence programs.
                </p>

                <p>Compared to pre-existing AIs, AlphaZero significantly reduces energy use by decreasing
                    the time spent training, and by using more energy-efficient technology. Other boardgame AIs
                    learned the game through years of human gameplay, by mimicking the natural human experience
                    of learning. AlphaZero, however, trains by itself through a process called self-play reinforcement
                    learning, which played itself in iteration after iteration, honing its skills by trial and error
                    [2]. The
                    only inputs are the rules of each game. By playing with itself for thousands of times, it shortens
                    the training time down to just a few hours, dramatically reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
                    by using the latest energy-efficient hardware designed specifically for machine learning (such as
                    TPUs, or tensor processing units), it further cuts down energy use. Although AlphaZero still uses
                    much more energy compared to the human brain [1], the gap is quickly closing.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, AlphaZero achieves extraordinary performance compared to other
                    intelligence programs, which further demonstrates its efficiency. In the games of Go, chess, and
                    shogi, it can outperform other AIs designed specifically for one board game, despite the
                    dramatically shorter training time. In terms of energy use, as other AIs have different levels of
                    energy consumption depending on the game, AlphaZero still averages out to use less energy [1].</p>

                <p>Furthermore, AlphaZero lays out the foundation for building increasingly intelligent and
                    energy-efficient AIs. This is not just applicable to learning human-designed games, but also in
                    learning other human tasks. One limitation, however, is that all computer programs need to be
                    created by humans and require some human “input” as a starting point of training, whether it is
                    rules, guidelines, or data [1]. It is not yet considered true “intelligence” as AIs still mimic
                    human
                    behavior through these inputs and do not yet learn completely from self-exploration. Although
                    AIs can outperform humans in some specialized tasks, there are still numerous tasks in this world
                    where the “inputs” do not yet exist [1]. There is no need to worry that AIs will outsmart humans
                    completely. Yet, the level of intelligence and efficiency in AIs today is sufficient to replace
                    certain human tasks, which may exaggerate problems such as unemployment and the wealth gap.</p>

                <p>AlphaZero is a lively demonstration that AIs are quickly improving, both in performance
                    and efficiency. Although some environmental benefits still exist, such as reduced energy
                    consumption and shorter training time, the implications it has on current AIs suggests that it has
                    the ability to outperform humans in specialized tasks, thus can still replace humans in some areas.

                <img src="pics/credit.jpg" alt="Power Lines" style="width:80%;">

                <p>In a world dominated by artificial intelligence, it is common for data-driven algorithms to replace
                    human
                    decision-making. However, it has been revealed that in many applications, the composition of data
                    used by the
                    algorithms can skew their decisions, thus marginalizing some under-represented or disadvantaged
                    groups in the
                    data. This results in unethical decisions being made that reinforces stereotypes and systematic
                    discrimination. </p>

                    money.
                    It is important since people often need to borrow money to make large purchases or start businesses.
                    A lower
                    credit score will prevent some from these opportunities to improve their standard of living, thus
                    widening the
                    economic gap [1]. Even though it is illegal to take race into account of credit, studies have shown
                    that there
                    is a great disparity in average credit scores between races [2]. This is mainly caused by factors
                    used to
                    determine credit scores, such as income, debt, family credit history, and location. These factors
                    often
                    reflect deep racial trends (for instance, poorer neighborhoods dominated by African Americans have
                    lower
                    income and higher debt), resulting in lower credit scores for these people [1]. These marginalized
                    groups are
                    thus given less opportunity to improve their situations (for instance, less loans to receive higher
                    education
                    or to start a business), which reinforces their marginalization. This results in a feedback loop
                    that is
                    systemically discriminating and widens the economic gap between groups.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, based on the example of bank credit scores, it could be shown that all types of
                    credit-ranking
                    algorithms are inherently discriminatory and unethical. In some countries, in addition to collecting
                    the
                    information listed above, other information such as social media accounts, cellphone data, and work
                    performance are collected [3]. They can also impact other areas in addition to taking loans. China’s
                    infamous
                    social credit system, for example, takes information including public behavior and internet activity
                    into
                    account, and can impact a person’s travel privileges and internet access [3]. In general, the more
                    factors
                    that an algorithm takes into calculating a person’s credit score, the more barriers it presents to
                    certain
                    groups from becoming unmarginalized. This then creates a greater obstacle from achieving social
                    equality. By
                    utilitarian ethics, this lack of equality in opportunity results in less overall benefit for the
                    society by
                    reinforcing these societal divisions and giving less freedom to the people [4]. Even though efforts
                    are
                    underway to reduce systemic discrimination in credit-ranking systems by making them government-run,
                    the global
                    shift towards a free market could undo these efforts [3].</p>

                <p>Overall, the design of credit-ranking systems only strengthens existing stereotypes and bias between
                    different social groups by considering factors that first created these differences. This design
                    flaw makes it
                    inherently unethical, by reducing overall freedom and equal access to opportunity for these
                    marginalized
                    groups. There are countless other examples where flawed data collection results in unjust decisions
                    made by
                    data-driven algorithms. As the world enters the age of machine intelligence, the possibilities
                    presented in
                    Black Mirror could become reality.</p>

                <h5>Technology Analysis, Dec. 4, 2017</h5>
                <img src="pics/power lines.jpg" alt="Power Lines" style="width:80%;">

                <p>The world is facing an energy crisis. According to Prof. Benjamin K. Sovacool, global energy
                    shortages
                    frequently result from regional conflicts or disasters that affect the supply of oil [1]. This is
                    because many
                    countries rely on the import of energy sources [1]. For the same reason, countries spend billions of
                    dollars
                    on energy each year importing oil [1]. Meanwhile, man-made climate change resulting from greenhouse
                    gases
                    produced by burning fossil fuels is also worsening. This causes problems such as increased severe
                    weather and
                    global sea level rise [2].</p>

                <p>Many countries have been working to phase out fossil fuels by implementing renewable energy systems.
                    Denmark,
                    for example, has taken actions such as taxing fossil fuels, building clean energy infrastructure,
                    and
                    improving energy efficiency [1]. However, such operations are not feasible in many other areas
                    around the
                    world, especially in large, highly capitalist countries such as the United States. This is because
                    it is
                    challenging to decentralize energy distribution in a large country; and in a more capitalist system,
                    the
                    government has less control on market decisions compared to the consumers, so it is more difficult
                    to make
                    energy policies. Since renewable energy is more expensive than fossil fuels, and cannot meet the
                    technical
                    requirements,
                    it is less desirable by the public. Thus, there is a need for improved renewable energy systems that
                    can rival
                    fossil fuels in terms of cost-efficiency and performance. </p>

                <p>To analyze this issue, the actor-network theory is used. The larger "actor-network" represents the
                    renewable
                    energy system, and the "actors" are different aspects of it, such as an energy storage device. Each
                    "actor" is
                    composed of its own "entities" that interact with the "actor" in specific manners, and this form an
                    "actor-world". For instance, a battery ("actor") has various physical and chemical properties
                    ("entities")
                    that determine its technical performance [3].</p>

                <p>One of the crucial technological barriers is the lack of cheap, efficient, and small-scale energy
                    storage. It
                    is a key "actor" in the "actor network" of clean energy systems. Electricity
                    storage is required for renewable energy systems today mainly because the energy sources are not
                    consistent.
                    Unlike fossil fuels, which generate a constant supply of electricity; wind, solar,
                    hydro, and tidal power all have variabilities due to weather, geography, and other natural
                    conditions [4]. In
                    the "actor world" of a renewable energy grid, it would be difficult to balance
                    the demand when supply "entities" are inconsistent, if there is nowhere for extra power to be
                    stored, and
                    nowhere to get power when supply is low. For example, in California, the solar power industry
                    struggled with
                    balancing the electricity supply and demand, which in some cases, it had to sell excess electricity
                    to
                    neighboring states as it had little storage to accommodate overgeneration [5]. Also, power storage
                    is required
                    for "entities" such as cars, ships, and planes, as well as individual homes that generate its own
                    electricity
                    from renewable sources. Therefore, to reduce the cost of clean energy and to allow for its greater
                    implementation for replacing fossil fuels, a cost-efficient method of energy storage is needed in
                    the "actor
                    network".</p>

                <p>Thus, electrical storage batteries are considered for this "actor" role. At present, however, battery
                    technology is still limited. Most batteries today are lithium-ion cells; yet, it has some major
                    flaws that
                    make it unsuitable for the "actor" role. One of the limitations is its complex manufacturing process
                    involving
                    many small components [7], which significantly drives up its cost. Currently, even the best lithium
                    ion
                    batteries from Tesla, the Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2, has a cost-efficiency of around $400/kWh
                    commercially
                    [8]; but according to MIT professor and battery expert Donald Sadoway, in order to compete with
                    fossil fuels
                    and replace them, the costefficiency needs to be $100/kWh or less [6]. Also, lithium ion batteries
                    degrade
                    significantly after repeated recharging. Most batteries today are only able to withstand 500-1000
                    chargedischarge cycles before their capacity falls drastically [9], but Sadoway believes that grid
                    operation
                    requires the batteries to be a lot more durable than that [6]. Furthermore, the capacity of most
                    lithium ion
                    batteries is only enough to serve as backup for short-term power shortages in the grid for a few
                    hours, which
                    is their primary use today [10]. Implementing it for full-scale electrical storage in a renewable
                    energy grid
                    would be far too expensive for consumers to use, or for nations to adopt. Therefore, the
                    technological gap
                    exists for the development of a low-cost and efficient battery to commercially replace fossil fuels.
                </p>

                <img src="pics/lmb.jpg" alt="LMB" width=400> <img src="pics/ambri.png" alt="Ambri" width=400>

                <p>One feasible technological solution is the liquid metal battery (LMB). Ambri, a company founded by
                    Donald
                    Sadoway, specializes in producing LMBs. By examining the "actor world" of Ambri and the LMB
                    technology, it is
                    obvious that LMBs could be fulfill the "actor" role of energy storage. According to Sadoway, LMBs
                    can be
                    easily manufactured since it uses inexpensive and "earth-abundant" materials [6], as well as a
                    simple
                    structure composed of just three layers (two liquid metal electrodes and one molten salt electrolyte
                    in
                    between) that separate themselves just by material properties [11]. Due to its simple composition,
                    LMB cells
                    can be easily scaled up in size without changing the chemical properties, unlike conventional
                    lithium ion
                    cells that are fixed in size options [7]. This way, a lower number of larger cells would need to be
                    wired
                    together when building a battery, which decreases the manufacturing complexity and cost. Sadoway has
                    said that
                    this design "takes advantage of the economies of scale inherent to electro-metallurgy and
                    conventional
                    manufacturing" [6]. Thus, all these "entities" of the LMB render it a lot cheaper compared to
                    existing battery
                    designs, in some cases, as low as $25/kWh (compared to ~$400/kWh for the best Tesla models [8]) [6].
                    This
                    cost-efficiency clearly rivals fossil fuels, and raises more hope for renewable energy systems with
                    batteries
                    to phase out fossil fuels. In addition, the modular design of LMBs meant it can also be configured
                    based on
                    customer needs, such as for home use, transportation use, or industrial purposes [11]. Furthermore,
                    LMBs are
                    "unparalleled" in durability compared to other types of batteries due to the chemical reactions that
                    take
                    place during charging and discharging processes [11]. Sadoway claims that from testing results, LMBs
                    can
                    retain over 99% of its initial capacity after 10 years of daily cycling [6]. This also meets the
                    demands of
                    grid-level implementation. Thus, when placed in the "actor network" of the renewable energy system,
                    the LMB
                    has the potential to fulfill the "actor" role of a cost-efficient power storage device. It could be
                    the
                    missing technological link to renewable energy systems. Not only does it meet the technical
                    requirements of
                    energy storage, but it is also inexpensive enough to become a permanent replacement for fossil
                    fuels.</p>

                <p>If implemented, LMBs would drastically change the energy industry, and render the world more
                    utilitarian. Due
                    to its low cost and high performance compared to fossil fuels, consumers, especially those in the
                    capitalist
                    world, would be more inclined to use renewable energy. Amid the United States' withdrawal from the
                    Paris
                    Climate Accord due to economic concerns [12], LMB technology, combined with renewable energy
                    systems, could
                    provide the U.S. a feasible solution for it to take initiative on phasing out fossil fuels and
                    reducing carbon
                    emissions. Although the traditional energy industry may suffer from these changes, the general
                    public would
                    benefit from greatly benefit from lower energy costs, more independence on energy supply (instead of
                    importing), and cleaner environment from reduction of carbon emissions. This is utilitarian, since
                    it creates
                    "greater happiness" for the "greater majority" [13]. Furthermore, the increased use of renewable
                    energy made
                    possible by LMBs would result in less regional or global energy shortages, and less conflicts
                    related to
                    energy resources [1]. This impact is also utilitarian. All these benefits associated with the LMB
                    demonstrates
                    that it fulfils the missing technological link to promoting renewable energy and phasing out fossil
                    fuels.</p>

                <p>A lot more technological, political, and economic progress still needs to be made before fossil fuels
                    can be
                    fully phased out by renewable energy. Yet, the liquid metal battery fulfills a key role of a
                    cost-efficient
                    and high-performance energy storage in the "actor network" of renewable energy systems. This is made
                    possible
                    by its special chemical properties and innovative design from Ambri, which makes the LMB better than
                    fossil
                    fuels in terms of performance and cost. When implemented, the LMB could have positive impacts on not
                    only the
                    energy consumers, but also for maintaining the world energy stability, and mitigating man-made
                    climate change.
                    The liquid metal battery is the missing technological link to renewable energy systems and replacing
                    fossil
                    fuels.</p>

                <h5>Technology Ethical Analysis, Oct. 19, 2017</h5>
                <img src="pics/solar panel.jpg" alt="Solar Power" style="width:80%;">

                <p>Every element of our industrialized world requires energy to function. For more than a century, the
                    use of
                    fossil fuels such as oil and coal has greatly shaped how society functions. As the world moves away
                    from
                    fossil fuels and nuclear power due to, the use of renewable energy, especially solar power, is on
                    the rise.
                    Solar power can also impact society in unthinkable ways, as
                    every technology in the past did. These societal changes are inevitable since energy plays such a
                    crucial role
                    in people's lives. This essay examines how solar power technology is utilitarian as it does greater
                    good and
                    brings greater happiness for the public, and how it can also be communitarian as it promotes shared
                    values and
                    community over the control of the capitalist elite.</p>

                <p>The first implication is that solar power is utilitarian. According to economist John Stuart Mill,
                    utilitarianism is the belief that the purpose of ethics is to make society better by increasing
                    things which
                    can "bring greater good and happiness for the public" [1]. Solar power can achieve this since it
                    allows people
                    to be more self-sufficient, while helping some parts of the world develop. Unlike oil,
                    hydroelectric, or
                    nuclear power, solar power generation usually does not require a centralized plant, or a top-down
                    distribution
                    network controlled by a large organization. Means of solar power generation and electricity storage
                    devices
                    can be installed on individual homes and anything that can hold them, from streetlights to cars to
                    smartphones. All these solar-powered units can operate independently from the power grid or external
                    fuel like
                    gasoline. Thus, widespread implementation of solar power would put significantly less demand on the
                    power
                    grid, centralized power generation, and fossil fuels. In addition, since solar-generated electricity
                    is
                    projected to become cheaper than the power grid in the coming years [5], even more people are likely
                    to switch
                    to over. Although large oil and utility companies may be driven out of business, the public would
                    benefit from
                    solar power by enjoying lower costs and achieving energy independence. People can worry less about
                    power
                    outages or shortages, their energy consumption, or paying hefty electricity and gasoline bills. This
                    would
                    bring more freedom, and greater happiness for the majority. Furthermore, the low cost and
                    portability of solar
                    power can benefit people in poor regions of the world with no access to any power sources. For
                    example, in
                    sub-Saharan Africa, where a majority of the population live without electricity [2]; installing
                    solar power
                    would provide the people there with a clean and inexpensive source of electricity. One startup
                    called Off-Grid
                    in Tanzania offers customers solar power kits with necessities including a solar panel, a battery,
                    LED lights,
                    a phone charger, a radio, and a flat-screen TV, for a price that the locals can afford. This allowed
                    the
                    people to access information and connect with the rest of the world [2]. Also, in Ghana, solar power
                    allowed
                    the vaccine for yellow fever to be safely stored, while letting residents to charge their cell
                    phones at home
                    rather than walking to a distant location to do so [2]. Solar power established connectivity in
                    these
                    societies, which helped them develop much faster, and brought greater good to the region. Thus, in a
                    solar
                    powered world, people become more self-sufficient; the greater good that solar power brings to
                    society
                    demonstrates that has a utilitarian ecology.</p>

                <p>As people become more independent on energy with solar power, it leads to a second implication that
                    solar
                    power is communitarian. The idea of communitarianism emphasizes the "modes of conflict resolution
                    that rely on
                    shared values, customs, and traditions, without the exercise of power" [3]. Solar power can attain
                    this by
                    promoting community values over individual profit, while reshaping the condescending capitalist
                    power
                    structure into a more equal state. It has been predicted that once every household installs solar
                    panels, the
                    supply and demand of solar power will not be constant. It is dependent on the weather, the time of
                    the day, as
                    well as electrical usage patterns. To match the supply and demand, a power grid is still needed.
                    However, its
                    main role is to balance the supply and demand, not generating the power. Power companies would need
                    to store
                    excess electricity from the customers when there is high supply and low demand, and distribute it
                    back to the
                    consumers when there is low supply and high demand [4]. Therefore, instead of serving as the
                    "overlooker" like
                    is has always been, power companies now take a "mediator" role, while the current consumers become
                    both the
                    supplier and consumer. This creates an equal relationship between utility companies and households,
                    which is a
                    communitarian characteristic. On the other hand, when corporations and governments control
                    electricity and
                    oil, they are free to manipulate the price and distribution, often for corporal benefit or national
                    interests.
                    This is consistent with the capitalist society we have lived in, where the notion of profit stands
                    above
                    everything else. However, when electricity generation is on the hands of individuals, oil and
                    utility
                    companies lose the control they have on these people's lives, thus, putting more power on the
                    public. Since
                    electricity and gasoline are essential elements of daily life, changing their supply network with
                    solar power
                    can make a significant impact on the societal structure. Solar power could shift society towards a
                    more
                    mutually-supportive, or communitarian state, instead of the pyramid-like power structure in a
                    capitalist
                    economy.</p>

                <p>More importantly, amid global climate change, a quick transition to solar power and other clean
                    energy
                    sources would be beneficial to all of mankind, by putting less pressure on our planet.
                    Although the world is still deeply divided between fossil fuels and clean energy, it is a losing
                    battle for
                    the former. Currently, numerous nations including Britain, France, Germany, China, and India are
                    coming
                    together to put a ban on fossil fuels [6]. Meanwhile, nations such as the United States are being
                    singled out
                    from the global community for their self-centered energy policies, especially after the US
                    withdrawal from the
                    Paris Climate Accord. Also, the growing attention on Tesla for their products reflects what society
                    is
                    seeking. As fossil fuels encourage corporations to continue exploiting our planet for profit, solar
                    power
                    unites societies together to combat climate change and save the environment. It is clear that solar
                    power
                    promotes community values over individual benefit. Overall, from the technical, political, and
                    environmental
                    viewpoints, the various characteristics of solar power technology shows that it is communitarian in
                    nature.
                </p>

                <p>The world is only at the dawn of the solar-powered age. Communities entirely powered by solar energy
                    are
                    still in the planning phases, and have not yet been materialized [7]. Thus, the ecology of solar
                    power
                    technology will not be fully understood until it becomes a predominant part of society. However,
                    from the
                    arising evidence today on the impacts of solar power, it can be hypothesized that a solar-powered
                    world will
                    be more utilitarian as it allows people to be more self-sufficient than before, and will be more
                    communitarian
                    since it unites the individuals of society into communities that will weaken the capitalist power
                    structure.

                <p>Engineering design process is not the same for everyone. It can vary based on personal strengths,
                    values, and
                    preferences, as well as the team dynamics that someone is a part of. Based on my experiences in the
                    Praxis
                    course, particularly Praxis II, I developed my personal engineering design process roughly based on
                    the Praxis
                    model of engineering design process (Framing, Diverging, Converging, Representing; shown in figure
                    below), but
                    with a lot of modifications.</p>

                <p><i>Figure 1: Flowchart representation of my personal engineering process</i></p>

                <p>To maximize my strengths of visualization, prototyping, and testing, as well as my value of designing
                    for
                    usability (functionality) and accessibility, my personal engineering design process emphasizes on
                    visualizing
                    the opportunity, building functional prototypes, and testing protocols. In addition, my current
                    process allows
                    for shift in phases (such as reframing, and retesting) to allow for more fluidity, or shift in
                    phases, if one
                    step does not go right. By using this process, I believe that not only I can gain the most from the
                    design
                    experience, but I can also maximize my contribution in a team setting.</p>

                <h3>Framing</h3>
                <p>According to Design Engineering Manual, every engineering design process begins with some form of
                    framing.
                    The process of framing is to identify the tasks or objectives, establish the design functions,
                    requirements,
                    and specifications. [8]</p>

                <p>In my personal engineering design process, I usually like to start framing the design opportunity by
                    collecting evidence through direct engagement with the target community or the stakeholders. This
                    usually
                    involves site visits of the location/facility and interviews of the stakeholders in order to gain
                    the most
                    direct information. Secondary information would be obtained through research. All the information
                    would be
                    collected as "field notes", which serves the basis of understanding a community and any design
                    opportunities
                    present in that community. An example of my field notes from Praxis II can be found here [2].</p>

                <img src="pics/image1.jpg" alt="1" width=400> <img src="pics/image2.png" alt="2" width=400>
                <p><i>Figure 3/4: Example of raw field notes taken from different site visits of the same location
                        during the
                        first phase of Praxis II [2]</i></p>

                <p>The raw field notes are then analyzed to further understand the community or the opportunity. Since I
                    prefer
                    incorporating visuals, I would map out all the information using flowcharts or mind-maps, like the
                    ones shown
                    in Figure 5 and 6, by including all the information/research gathered.</p>

                        service
                        procedure at a Chinese restaurant [2][3]</i></p>

                <p>From here, I am able to set design objectives that would cover the needs and wants of the
                    stakeholders and
                    resolve the issue. Again, when coming up with different objectives, metrics, criteria, and
                    constraints, I like
                    to connect them all together through visuals, as exemplified in Figure 7. This way, all the
                    attributes can be
                    connected back to the needs of the stakeholders and the high-level objectives. It is a way to ensure
                    that the
                    process stays on track and does not go off topic.</p>

                <h3>Diverging</h3>
                <p>Diverging is often needed in engineering design to generate a wide variety of ideas, and to prevent
                    anchoring
                    a specific idea.</p>

                <p>My diverging process usually begins with a brainstorming session with my design team, as everyone can
                    come up
                    with unique design ideas. This usually involves taking a design brief, and in a certain amount of
                    time, each
                    team member should come up with a certain number of ideas (Figure 8). When it comes to individual
                    brainstorming techniques, I prefer the Lotus Blossom Technique [4] as it is more simple to diverge
                    from a
                    general idea by adding various details. As shown in Figure 9, the technique begins with a keyword in
                    the
                    centre, and some general/baseline ideas. Each base design can then be diversified by adding specific
                    details.
                    This method usually generates a good number of ideas that ensures diversity and uniqueness.</p>

                <p><i>Figure 8 (Left): Some of my individual brainstorming ideas from a session in Phase 2, Praxis II;
                        Figure 9
                        (Right): Visual representation of the Lotus Blossom Technique [5]</i></p>

                <p>I then get together with my teammates and combine certain ideas, or modify some ideas based on other
                    teammates' ideas. For this purpose, the Morph Chart (Figure 10) is a useful tool in which a basic
                    idea can be
                    extended or combined with other ideas to form more creative designs. Also, using the resources
                    available, my
                    team members and I build some mini, non-functional prototypes to demonstrate the concepts. All these
                    activities help us visualize our ideas better.</p>

                <img src="pics/img_20170319_1909491.jpg" alt="10" width=800>
                <p><i>Figure 10: Example of a Morph chart my team used to diversify ideas in Phase 2 of Praxis II</i>
                </p>

                <p>If my team and I run into problems during the diverging process, such as feeling very constrained by
                    the
                    design requirements, or feeling that the scope is too wide, we would go back and reframe the
                    opportunity. This
                    means going back to the basics, and doing more stakeholder interactions and research to redefine the
                    problem
                    and objectives. This happened during the beginning of the second phase of Praxis II , when my team
                    felt that
                    the scope of the opportunity presented in the Request for Proposal was too wide, so we decided to
                    conduct our
                    own site visits and background research, and finally chose to focus on one design aspect presented
                    in the RFP
                    instead of all three.</p>

                <h3>Converging / Representing</h3>
                <p>When it comes to converging ideas, I usually try to balance between System 1 (instinctive) and System
                    2
                    (logical reasoning) thinking. For System 2 thinking, this begins by developing testing protocols
                    that go along
                    with the metrics as outlined in the design brief. These testing procedures are usually rigorously
                    developed
                    based on existing standards, guidelines, and research papers. The protocols can either be carried
                    out
                    physically, or they can be easily justified based on research. An example of a testing protocol my
                    team and I
                    have developed in Phase 2 of Praxis II can be seen here.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, as my team and I have done in Phase 2 of Praxis II, in order to have something
                    that we can
                    formally test on, my team and I spend time to build functional prototype(s). We believe that
                    usability and
                    functionality is more important than the processes used to reach a design decision. If time and
                    resources are
                    constrained, we would build proxy representations of certain aspects of each design that would
                    normally be
                    much more difficult to model. These proxy representations would serve the same function but are much
                    simpler
                    to construct.</p>

                <img src="pics/photo-2017-03-22-5-06-11-pm.jpg" alt="11" width=600>
                <p><i>Figure 11: A functional prototype developed for Phase 2 of Praxis II for Beta Release</i></p>

                <p>We would then perform beta-tests on the prototype(s) to make sure that they meet the basic
                    functionality
                    requirements. After the functionality is met, we then decide on the more detailed aspects of design.
                    We would
                    use any materials that we can easily get access to instead of the actual materials proposed in the
                    concept in
                    order to save time and money. The testing protocols are then used to determine the quality of each
                    design.
                    This process was evident when my Praxis II Team chose the cradle of rollers and swivel arm with
                    roller as the
                    base design, tested for its functionality, and added rubber rollers and motors as further design
                    details.</p>

                <img src="pics/17887344_878741408930890_1684891883_o.jpg" alt="11" width=500>
                <p><i>Figure 12: A functional prototype developed for Phase 2 of Praxis II for final Showcase. Notice
                        the
                        differences between this prototype and the final design concept (Fig. 15, 16, 17) as some parts
                        of this
                        prototype are proxies to how they are on the final design concept.</i></p>

                <p>Finally, to summarize all the testing results and how each design idea performs on the metrics, a
                    Pugh Chart
                    (Figure 13) or Pairwise Comparison Matrix (Figure 14) is used. A numerical comparison can be made by
                    adding up
                    the scores of each alternative on the chart, however, the final decision cannot be based on just a
                    score.
                    Here, I would judge each design by further research, logical reasoning, and some instinctive
                    thought.</p>

                <img src="pics/pugh.png" alt="pugh" width=500><img src="pics/pairwise.png" alt="pairwise" width=500>

                        2 of
                        Praxis II to converge ideas. </i></p>

                <p>The best design is usually chosen as the one that best satisfies the needs and wants of the
                    stakeholders, and
                    best resolves the existing issue. This is done through validation with the stakeholders, which is
                    the last
                    major step on my engineering design process. Validation is done by interacting with the stakeholders
                    and
                    taking in their feedback on our design concepts. All the comparison charts and scores can only be
                    seen as
                    guidelines, not the basis for an absolute decision.</p>

                <p>Every time after testing and validating, my team and I would make necessary improvements to the
                    concepts, and
                    then repeat the testing and validation procedures. Ideally, this would be continued until the design
                    meets all
                    the requirements and fully satisfies the needs of the stakeholders. Between Beta Release and
                    Showcase of Phase
                    2, Praxis II, we repeated this process, where we completely changed up our original design after it
                    did not
                    work properly during our testing. We eventually came up with a much more improved design that is
                    fully
                    functional and validated (Figure 15, 16, 17). You can read more about our final design here.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>An engineering design process is never concrete. It is a constantly evolving process that changes
                    from time
                    to time, and from one iteration to another. Through the course of Praxis I and II, over two full
                    iterations of
                    the Praxis design model, my engineering design process has changed from the linear model of Frame,
                    Diverge,
                    Converge, and Represent after Praxis I to the process that I currently have, which allows for more
                    fluidity
                    and shift in phases when needed.</p>

                <p>My current personal engineering design process is largely based on the experiences from Phase 2 of
                    Praxis II,
                    after my design team and I experienced multiple setbacks and changes in strategy. The fluidity of my
                    current
                    process allows more room for error and adjustment, which is often needed in successful engineering
                    design as
                    not all design processes go smoothly without issues. If my team and I had followed a more linear
                    design
                    process, the outcomes in Praxis II would have not been the same.</p>

                <p>This current process also helps me maximize my strengths, such as visualization, prototyping, and
                    testing, as
                    these aspects are more emphasized in my process. I believe that by integrating these aspects into a
                    team
                    setting, I can contribute the most to teamwork. In my opinion, good teamwork is the ability to
                    combine
                    individual strengths of team members while maintaining a central team identity or value.</p>

                <p>One aspect that I still need to work on is that I still tend to anchor on one particular design idea.
                    I need
                    to control my System 1 (instinct) and use more System 2 (logical reasoning) to compare the ideas. I
                    should try
                    to not get caught up on certain details that appear to be amazing and forget the big picture. Also,
                    I should
                    rely more on standards and guidelines to justify my ideas rather than using instinct.</p>

                <p>Moving forward, I think it is important to look back every now and then, evaluate what I have done,
                    identify
                    the successes and areas of improvement in the way how I tackled a design problem, and make the
                    necessary
                    adjustments to my engineering design process. It is a constant learning process to know what
                    processes works
                    for me the best, and what aspects I am really good at. Then again, I am only a first year student
                    engineer,
                    and I have a lifelong journey ahead of me, where I will undoubtedly make changes to the elements of
                    my design
                    process. I hope that through experience and practice, I continue to grow as an engineer, and
                    continue to make
                    a difference in my community.</p>

                    daily
                    life. Since my schedule is tight, I am quite bothered by traffic jams and public transit delays that
                    increase
                    my commute time. Moreover, thousands of Torontonians and people living in other major cities must
                    feel the
                    same. As a result, I am looking forward to any possibilities that can reduce traffic congestion in
                    urban
                    areas.</p>

                <p>The very first lecture at ESEC immediately caught my attention when I learned that artificial
                    intelligence
                    can be applied to manage traffic. In the lecture, Professor Baher Abdulhai, the director of Toronto
                    Intelligent Transportation Systems Centre and Testbed [1], discussed about his research and the
                    projects he is
                    working on with the city of Toronto. He applies machine learning and AI to elements of the traffic
                    grid,
                    including traffic lights, signs, and buses. Through machine learning, the elements of the traffic
                    grid can
                    adapt to real-time conditions and allow maximum flow of traffic in each direction. It also
                    prioritizes buses
                    and streetcars over cars since they carry more people. Moreover, in the coming years, when
                    autonomous vehicles
                    are integrated into the system, they can communicate with each other and with the traffic grid
                    elements to
                    maximize the flow of traffic. His test results on a computer simulation of the Toronto road grid
                    have shown
                    that his intelligent transportation system has significantly reduced travel times compared to now.
                </p>

                <p>Prof. Abdulhai suggests that the main goal of AI is to spread the traffic out in time, space, and
                    transportation mode, so congestion can be decreased. While most people would not understand,
                    controlling the
                    amount of traffic entering the system is crucial to reducing congestion. When the roads exceed their
                    design
                    capacity, the amount of traffic that can pass through at a given time noticeably decreases. By
                    keeping the
                    roads at below its maximum capacity, a steady flow of traffic can be ensured.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, there has recently been a huge debate in Toronto on the tolls on Don Valley Parkway and
                    Gardiner
                    Expressway. While Mayor John Tory announced that a permanent toll should be charged at all times
                    [2], Prof.
                    Abdulhai showed us with his research that a time-based tolling system should be implemented instead.
                    With a
                    permanent toll, he demonstrated in his simulation that it will cause traffic backups in the main
                    streets
                    parallel to the highways because most cars will try to avoid it. This, in return, worsens the
                    congestion.
                    However, with a time-based tolling system (with higher tolls charged at busier time intervals), it
                    will cause
                    commuters to travel earlier or later, or use other modes of transportation instead of driving. This
                    relieves
                    the system at peak travel times.</p>

                <p>There are still plenty of research to be done in this field, such as modelling the modes of
                    transportation
                    that people uses, the behaviour of pedestrians, and determining the optimal times of the day for
                    different
                    kinds of workers to commute.</p>

                <h5>Engineering Design Decision, Nov. 16, 2016</h5>
                <img src="pics/gym.jpg" alt="Gym" style="width:100%;">

                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <h4>1.1. Background</h4>
                <p>In first year university, "Freshmen 15" is a widespread phenomenon since students are often stressed
                    out from
                    increased schoolwork and other duties; and in addition to their poor eating and sleeping habits,
                    weight gain
                    is common [10]. As a former competitive swimmer and runner, I did not want to gain any "freshmen
                    pounds". I
                    decided that first year EngSci should not be an excuse to be out of shape. Thus, I continued working
                    out
                    regularly. </p>
                <p>There are at least 4 different locations that I go for workout. This includes Hart House, Athletic
                    Centre,
                    and Goldring Centre on the St. George Campus, as well as the Sheppard YMCA, which is close to
                    home.Usually, my
                    comprehensive dryland and swimming workouts requires the use of various equipment ranging from
                    rowing machines
                    to squat racks and bar bells, as well as a running track. As a commuter student, I need to save time
                    by
                    minimizing commute and waiting time for equipment.</p>

                <h4>1.2. Purpose/Goals</h4>
                <p>I need to choose a permanent workout location instead of going between all 4 places. The goal is to
                    minimize
                    wasted time and spend as little money as possible, while being able to do full body dryland
                    workouts, as well
                    as swimming workouts. </p>

                Most of the information is based on the official website of each location [1] [2] [3] [4], as well as
                information found from online reviews of each location [5] [6] [7] [8].<br>
                *Some information here is based on personal observations on-site.

                <h3>4. Recommendation and Suggestions</h3>
                <p>Athletic Centre is recommended since it has the most variety of equipment and relatively low
                    congestion. It
                    best fits with my high-level objectives of saving time, saving money, and maximizing workouts, as
                    well as most
                    of my detailed objectives and metrics. Personally, AC is also preferred because a lot of my
                    classmates also go
                    there for workout; thus, I get the chance to socialize and exercise at the same time. Most of my
                    classmates
                    here told me that AC is by far the best choice of workout location on campus. Also, based on online
                    reviews,
                    AC has received generally positive feedback. [5] [6] [7] [8]</p>

                <p>Athletic Centre could have been better overall if it is open for extended hours on weekends, giving
                    me more
                    flexibility in choosing the time for workouts. </p>

                <h5>Design for X Walkabout Report, Oct. 25, 2016</h5>
                <img src="pics/iphone7.jpg" alt="iPhone 7" style="width:100%;">

                <p>There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the design of the latest iPhone 7 and 7-Plus,
                    especially with
                    the removal of earphone jacks and the redesign of the home button. However, when I recently visited
                    an Apple
                    store and closely observed the features of iPhone 7 and 7-Plus, and then comparing it to previous
                    iPhone
                    generations (5s, 6, 6s, etc.), I realized that the design of iPhone 7 generation makes them more
                    durable
                    compared to previous models. These changes in design, including the removal of earphone jacks, the
                    redesign of
                    buttons and the home button, as well as the changes in the outer casing, render the iPhone 7 and
                    7-Plus more
                    resistant to water and dust; thus, iPhone 7 generation is designed for greater durability.</p>

                <img src="pics/5.png" alt="good render" width=600>
                <p><i>Fig. 1: comparison of iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s from the bottom</i></p>

                <p>The unconventional decision to remove the earphone jacks and the reset hole on the iPhone 7 can be
                    seen as an
                    effort to increase its resistance against water and dust [4], improving its overall durability. Most
                    smartphones prior to the iPhone 7/7-Plus are not designed to be water-repellant. There are lots of
                    cracks and
                    holes on the phone where water can easily enter, damaging its interior components. However, most
                    other
                    smartphones (especially Google, Android phones) are designed in a way that it can be easily opened
                    up to
                    access its interior. This allows the user to quickly dry and repair the interior in case of water
                    damage. On
                    the other hand, iPhones and other Apple mobile devices are not designed to be as accessible, which a
                    special
                    tool set is required to open up the device and access its interior. As a result, they become more
                    challenging
                    and costly to repair. By removing the earphone jacks and the reset hole on the iPhone 7/7-Plus,
                    there are less
                    channels for water to enter the interior of the device. Under the current design, there is a much
                    lower risk
                    of water damage to the interior components. According to waterproof tests conducted on the iPhone
                    7/7-Plus, it
                    received a rating of IP67 under IEC Standard 60529 [1]. According to IEC 60529, IP67 means that the
                    iPhone 7
                    is "totally dust-resistant", and "capable of surviving temporary immersion up to 1 meter for 30
                    minutes in
                    pure water" [1][2]. Even though it has been tested that iPhone 7/7-Plus is not totally waterproof,
                    its ability
                    to resist water and dust to this degree is a major improvement from previous smartphones. Therefore,
                    the
                    design decision to be water and dust-resistant is a great factor for its design for durability.</p>

                <p>An additional feature that make the iPhone 7 and 7-Plus more durable than previous iPhone generations
                    is the
                    redesign of the home button. Up until now, all the previous iPhone generations have used a
                    conventional
                    mechanical home button. The iPhone 7/7-Plus uses a solid-state, capacitive touch navigation home
                    button along
                    with a vibrator motor [4]. Unlike the traditional mechanical home button, which breaks down easily
                    after heavy
                    usage, the capacitive touch home button does not require force to be triggered (from observation
                    during my
                    Apple store visit). This makes it less likely to be broken from heavy usage. More importantly, the
                    iPhone 7's
                    home button is in one solid state with the phone itself, unlike previous generations where the home
                    button is
                    a separate piece. This improves the durability since it is less likely for dust to settle in the
                    cracks, or
                    for water to enter the interior of the phone through the cracks surrounding the button [3]. It is
                    another
                    feature that improves the water and dust resistance of the phone. The design of the home buttons is
                    a
                    significant improvement of the iPhone 7's durability.</p>

                <p><i>Fig. 2: Comparison of the home button between iPhone 7 and 6/6s</i></p>

                <p>Another minor detail I noticed during observation is that iPhone 7/7-Plus have their camera lenses
                    protected
                    by the cover around it. This feature makes the camera lenses more durable to potential fall damage
                    or impact,
                    as well as water and dust. As shown in Fig. 3, previous generations of iPhones, including iPhone
                    6/6s, have
                    their camera lenses exposed, surrounded only by a metal ring structure. Even though the metal ring
                    structure
                    offers a degree of protection, the camera lens is still vulnerable to fall impact, as well as water
                    and dust
                    leaking inside. The design of the iPhone 7/7-Plus better protects the camera lenses from these
                    problems.
                    Overall, these design features make the iPhone 7/7-Plus much more durable than other smartphones.

                <p><i>Fig. 3: Comparison of camera lens</i></p>

                <p>In summary, even though the design of iPhone 7/7-Plus may seem unconventional and controversial
                    compared to
                    other iPhones and smartphones, many of its design decisions are made so that the iPhone 7/7-Plus are
                    more
                    durable, and more resistant to dust and water. They may also be intended to improve the usability
                    and
                    accessibility of the phone. Despite the downsides to these design decisions, including the increased
                    cost of
                    manufacturing, maintenance, and repair, such design decisions can be a fair trade-off. Furthermore,
                    the design
                    of iPhone 7/7-Plus can lead to future developments such as water repellent smartphones, better
                    wireless
                    earplugs, and wireless charging technologies. Thus, the iPhone 7 generation can be seen as a
                    significant
                    technological upgrade on smartphones.</p>

                <h5>Lecture Extension Report, Sep. 29, 2016</h5>
                <img src="pics/wikipedia.jpg" alt="Wikipedia" style="width:100%;">


                <p>During the Praxis lecture on Monday, September 26th, we briefly discussed the idea of using Wikipedia
                    for
                    research. According to the lecture, Wikipedia is a good source if one is looking for basic
                    information; it is
                    a "stepping stone" for progressing into more advanced research (e.g. the links/references provided
                    under each
                    article). However, since Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone, it may be useful in certain
                    subjects, but
                    most of the time its credibility is low. Therefore, I decided to take a look into Wikipedia rules,
                    guidelines,
                    and policies, as well as Wikipedia articles from a few different subject areas. I would then apply
                    CRAAP tests
                    to see for which subject areas Wikipedia articles are more credible.</p>

                <p>In order to find out more about Wikipedia's policies and standards, I first went to their "List of
                    Policies"
                    page, where all kinds of policies are listed, including content, conduct, deletion, enforcement,
                    legal, and
                    procedural policies. As I went through the list, some of the policies caught my attention: 1.
                    Neutral point of
                    view; 2. No original research; 3. "Any unsourced material may be challenged and removed"; 4. "Don't
                    worry
                    about leaving them imperfect" when editing; 5. Consensus is needed to resolve issues [1]. Here, it
                    is clear
                    that Wikipedia has set some rules to at least make their articles seem credible; however, these
                    rules are not
                    strictly enforced, which means Wikipedia articles can still vary in quality. Since Wikipedia
                    articles can be
                    written or edited by anyone, the articles may still contain outdated information, bias, or they may
                    have been
                    posted by someone who is not an expert in the field or by someone who purposely provides false
                    information. I
                    specifically looked into the "Editing Policy" page, and some of the wording here seems striking. For
                    example,
                    the page describes that "Perfection is not required: Wikipedia is a work in progress" and that "Even
                    the best
                    articles should not be considered complete" [2]. In other words, Wikipedia articles do not have to
                    be complete
                    since other editors can build on the work that has already been done on an article. Also, Wikipedia
                    articles
                    for certain subjects of interest may be more reliable than others. This inconsistency in information
                    is not a
                    good sign for those researching using Wikipedia.</p>

                <p>According to the lecture, Wikipedia articles for engineering related subjects are of poor quality. I
                    decided
                    to look up Wikipedia articles on subjects related to engineering design: Engineering Design Process,
                    Design
                    for X, and Design for Manufacturability. As I scanned through the articles, I see a lot of red
                    flags: "This
                    article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards", "This article needs additional
                    citations
                    for verification", "This section is incomplete". Furthermore, these labels have been there since as
                    early as
                    2009. It is clear that these articles not only failed to meet Wikipedia standards, but also they
                    have not been
                    properly edited for a long time. Also, when I scanned through the content of each article, I notice
                    that some
                    of the information is off-topic. For example, in "Design for Manufacturability", after a short
                    intro, the
                    subsections contain "Design for manufacturability for printed circuit boards", "Design for
                    manufacturability
                    for integrated circuits", and "Design for manufacturability for CNC machining". These subsections
                    seem
                    completely irrelevant given the context of the article; and not only that, the information under
                    each section
                    seems to be plagiarized from a different source in loose pieces, as it appears loose and
                    disconnected.
                    Finally, when I checked the links provided below, many of the links are either currently defunct or
                    missing.
                    Overall, these three articles failed the CRAAP test and are not reliable references for research.
                </p>

                <p>From the lecture, I also heard that Wikipedia articles for computer science related subjects are more
                    consistent. I looked up some articles in this field: Quantum Computing and Internet of Things.
                    Although there
                    are some hiccups here and there labelled by Wikipedia, both articles are much longer and more
                    detailed
                    compared to the previous articles. To get a sense of how current the information is in these
                    articles, I
                    looked at the edit history of both articles, which showed that major edits have been done to both
                    articles
                    within the last 3 months. Such topics need to be frequently updated to keep up with the latest
                    information
                    possible. Scanning through both articles, there is not an obvious section in either article that is
                    off topic
                    or irrelevant. Also, most of the links provided below can be opened, with a lot of the references
                    being
                    official sources (.edu, .gov, .org, or research papers). The only flaw in both articles is that they
                    both
                    contain a lot of complex language and jargon that may not be understood by the average reader. Yet,
                    both
                    articles give a decent overview of the subject, and are much more reliable compared to the previous
                    ones I
                    have read. These articles are a good place to begin a research.</p>

                <p>From this quick activity, it can be seen that Wikipedia articles vary in consistency. Depending on
                    the
                    subject, some articles may be more reliable than others. Even though Wikipedia has a set of
                    guidelines and
                    policies of how the articles should be written, edited, and cited, they are not strictly enforced or
                    followed,
                    and this results in the lack of reliability. It may be a good idea to start a research using
                    Wikipedia
                    articles, since they provide an introduction and basic information about the subject, as well as
                    links to
                    other resources that might be useful. Yet, simply citing Wikipedia is far from adequate.</p>
