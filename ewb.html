		<h1>Engineers Without Borders</h1>
		<h3>University of Toronto Chapter</h3><br>

		<h2>Youth Engagement Portfolio</h2>
		<p>During first year (2016-2017), I was a part of Engineers Without Borders, University of Toronto chapter, in
			the Youth Engagement portfolio. </p>

		<p>I joined since it serves a mission of helping younger students develop engineering design skills to make
			social change. Through this experience, I believe that I am also making social change. I strongly believe
			that as a professional engineer, it is my mission to serve the community and help make a difference.</p>

		<h2>EWBoosters and YAIT</h2>
		<p>EWBoosters is the outreach branch of Youth Engagement that provides high schools in the GTA with resources to
			start their own EWB clubs. It is also responsible for hosting engineering and global development workshops,
			as well as hosting the annual Youth Action Initiative Toronto (YAIT) conference and case competition to be
			held in May.</p>

		<p>As the contents director of EWBoosters this year, I was given the task of developing engineering and global
			development workshops, as well as preparing the materials for Youth Action Initiative Toronto. Some of my
			work included a founding package for students interested in starting new EWB clubs, an engineering design
			process workshop, and a design brief for YAIT. (Selected content will be available in June)</p>

		<p>This year’s Youth Action Initiative Toronto is centred upon the opportunity of developing solutions to the
			housing crisis in the GTA. Student teams will be assigned DFXs and will compete for the best solution in
			each DFX category, as well as the best overall design.</p>

		<br>
		<h2>Innomasters</h2>
		<p>Innomasters is a mentorship program for which a team of high school students are paired up with mentors from
			EWB U of T, and work on a Praxis/ESP style design project in their local community through the term. It is
			split into stages (including a design brief, and a recommendation report). The project concludes in a final
			showcase that takes place in April.</p>

		<p>Volunteering as a mentor for this term, I guided a team of students from University of Toronto Schools (UTS).
			They developed upon the opportunity of WiFi at UTS since they experienced the poor WiFi system at their
			school. According to the survey that they conducted, the WiFi coverage was very poor in certain areas of the
			school, and that there is no restriction on using WiFi for purposes other than studying (video games, video
			watching/streaming, social media, etc.). Also, from interviewing the stakeholders, they found out that the
			current bandwidth is inadequate.</p>

		<p><i>Youth Engagement Team from Innomasters</i></p>

		<p>As I guided them through the project, they learned about the basic engineering design model in Praxis (Frame,
			Diverge, Converge, Represent), and I shared them with tools and techniques (such as Morph Charts, Pugh
			Chart, pairwise comparison, etc.) that they can use for each stage of design. I also helped them with any
			background and technical knowledge in hardware related to networks.</p>

		<p>In the final showcase, the team recommended a solution that integrated existing methods (such as relocating
			the routers) and future technologies (such as Li-Fi). The team was presented the award for the best
			research.</p><br>
