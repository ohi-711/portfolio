        <p>This paper describes the development of efficient, convenient, and 
            non-repetitive short assessments (e.g., surveys, tests, exams) to 
            replace a long assessment for conducting any kind of assessments of 
            people's behaviors, opinions, attitudes, mental and physical states, 
            traits (e.g., personality), and abilities (e.g., IQ), and skills 
            (e.g., music playing proficiency). The process involves (1) obtain 
            data for a particular long assessment (e.g., a scale for Generalized 
            Anxiety Disorder, GAD) from a large sample of participants, (2) derive 
            the ground truth scores from participants' responses to all items of the 
            long assessment (e.g., scores of GAD or class of GAD: with vs. with GAD),
            (3) use machine learning to select participants' response to a small set of 
            items of the long assessment to predict the ground truth accurately, 
            (4) obtain computational models that use the minimal number of items 
            needed to achieve the prediction accuracy as high as when the 
            responses to all items of the whole long assessment are used, 
            (5) generate all possible combinations of minimal number of items 
            to create multiple short assessments of similar predictive accuracies 
            for use if the short assessment is to be done repeatedly, (6) implement 
            the short assessments in computer programs, mobile apps, websites, clouds, 
            telemarketing, and any other forms for use with any future participant of 
            the assessment, (7) the implementation will randomly or non-randomly select 
            one subset of items to assess a particular participant using these platforms, 
            (7) the implementation will use the computational model based on the subset 
            of items to produce estimated scores as if the participant has done the 
            long assessment, and the confidence of the model's estimation in the form 
            of likelihood ratio or similar indexes.

        <p>This study applies a set of machine learning methods to develop a shortened, 
            100-item version of the MMPI-2 scale and evaluate its reliability and validity. 
            We first selected the most important items from the original 567-item MMPI scale 
            using feature importance measures such as MRMR and SHAP. Then we trained machine 
            learning models on the selected items using a novel machine learning method called 
            the stacked generalization ensemble of several machine learning techniques. 
            We were able to reduce the length of the MMPI-2 by over 82% from 567 items to 
            100 items. The shortened MMPI scales, denoted the MMPI-100, can measure the 10 
            target conditions with at least 85% Area Under Curve of the Receiver Operating 
            Characteristic (AUC ROC). It also has a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.96. Finally, we 
            implemented this shortened MMPI-2 scale into a mobile-friendly web application. 
            This shortened scale can not only help alleviate pressure on healthcare systems 
            for dealing with the increased number of patients with mental health concerns but 
            also for individuals to use it for regular mental health monitoring or screening.
